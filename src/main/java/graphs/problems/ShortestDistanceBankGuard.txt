Given a matrix that is filled with ‘O’, ‘G’, and ‘W’ where ‘O’ represents open space, ‘G’ represents guards and ‘W’ represents walls in a Bank. Replace all of the O’s in the matrix with their shortest distance from a guard, without being able to go through any walls. Also, replace the guards with 0 and walls with -1 in output matrix.

Expected Time complexity is O(MN) for a M x N matrix.

Examples:

O ==> Open Space
G ==> Guard
W ==> Wall

Input:
  O  O  O  O  G
  O  W  W  O  O
  O  O  O  W  O
  G  W  W  W  O
  O  O  O  O  G

Output:
  3  3  2  1  0
  2 -1 -1  2  1
  1  2  3 -1  2
  0 -1 -1 -1  1
  1  2  2  1  0
