How Many Binary Search Trees With n Nodes?





Problem Statement:



Write a function that will return the number of binary search trees that can be constructed, with n nodes.



There may be other iterative solutions, but for the purpose of this exercise, please use recursive solution.



Input Format:



There is only one argument denoting integer n.



Output Format:



Return number of binary search trees that can be constructed, with n nodes.



Constraints:



1 <= n <= 16


Sample Test Cases:



Sample Input 1:



1



Sample Output 1:



1



Explanation 1:



1) root (node val = 1)



Sample Input 2:



2



Sample Output 2:



2



Explanation 2:



1) root (node val = 2), root->left (node val = 1)

2) root (node val = 1), root->right (node val = 2)



Sample Input 3:



3



Sample Output 3:



5



Explanation 3:



1) root (node val = 3), root->left (node val = 2), root->left->left (node val = 1)

2) root (node val = 3), root->left (node val = 1), root->left->right (node val = 2)

3) root (node val = 1), root->right (node val = 2), root->right->right (node val = 3)

4) root (node val = 1), root->right (node val = 3), root->right->left (node val = 2)

5) root (node val = 2), root->left (node val = 1), root->right (node val = 3)
